# AptTool

This tool is for searching package names and descriptions in the apt-cache,
listing dependencies/reverse-dependencies and suggested packages.

It also handles installs, upgrades, removals/purges, and some other stuff
(reverse file searches, history searching). By using regex or plain-text you
can quickly find a package by part of a name, or part of a description.
The real package name, install-state, and description will be listed for all
packages that match (or don't match when --reverse  is used).
There are options to search names only, or omit the descriptions when printing
results.

Results are shown as they are found, so even if searching the packages is
taking too long you will normally see some results right away.
You can always `Ctrl + C` if you already found what you were looking for.
Using the `--containsfile`  option you can reverse-search a file to find out
what package it came from (if any).
You can also list all installed-files for a package using the `--files`
option.

Obviously, a package must already be installed to list the installed-files.
The `-V` option will show the current version information for a package,
and when coupled with `-a` , can show all available versions.
It will always tell you if the latest version is installed or not.
The install, remove, and purge options work. They don't offer much of an
improvement over the usual apt-get install|remove|purge methods, except maybe
some colorization, unless you just really hate typing and prefer
`apttool -i|-d|-p`.

## Dependencies

These are installable with `pip`, except maybe `apt_pkg`, which comes
installed on debian-based systems.

* `python-apt`: Provides the apt cache and related methods.
* `apt_pkg`: `python-apt` depends on this, as it provides helpers for
individual apt packages.
* `colr`: Provides terminal colors.
* `docopt`: Provides command-line argument parsing.
* `formatblock`: Provides easy text block formatting.

                                   are read from the file. If '-' is
                                   given, names are read from stdin.
    PATTERNS                     : One or more text/regex patterns to
                                   search for. Multiple patterns will be
                                   joined with (.+)? if -a is used,
                                   otherwise they are joined with |.
    QUERY                        : Query to filter history with. The

                                   When searching, join all patterns so
                                   they must all be found in the exact
                                   argument order.
                                   Like doing (arg1)(.+)?(arg2).

                                   It just shows files installed to
                                   /bin directories.
    -f,--files                   : Show installed files for package.
                                   Multiple package names may be
                                   comma-separated, or passed with
                                   multiple flags.

                                   read from, or use - for stdin.
                                   Otherwise a full package name is
                                   needed. Multiple names can be passed.
    -L,--LOCATE                  : Same as --locate, but only shows
                                   existing packages that are found.

                                   When locating, don't show the install

    -V,--VERSION                 : Show a package's installed or available

    -x,--ignorecase              : Make the search query case-insensitive.
```

## Example Usage

Shows installed packages with 'foo' in the name or desc.
```
apttool foo -I
```

Show non-installed packages with 'bar' in the name only.
```bash
apttool bar -n -N
```

Show installed files for the 'python' package.
```bash
apttool -f python
```

Show installed executables for the 'python' package.
```bash
apttool -e python
```

Show suggested packages for the 'python' package.
```bash
apttool -S python
```

Determine whether a full package name exists in the cache.

This is quicker than a full search.
```bash
apttool -l pythonfoo
```

Search dpkg history for latest installs/half-installs.
```bash
apttool -H install
```

Show packages containing files with 'foo' in the path.
```bash
apttool -c foo
```

### Marker Legend:

Results are prepended with a marker that shows it's install state.

Marker | Description
:---:|---
i | Package is installed.
u | Package is not installed.
? | Package name was not found in the cache.

### Notes:

If no options are given, the default behaviour is to search for
packages by name and description, then print results.

## AptTool-Show

There is a little helper script included (`apttool-show.sh`), that basically
wraps `dpkg (-l|-s) PACKAGE...`, except it colorizes the output.

```
Usage:
    apttool-show -h | -v
    apttool-show [-l] PACKAGE...

Options:
    PACKAGE       : Package name to look up.
                    If the package name contains a * character then -l
                    is implied.
    -h,--help     : Show this message.
    -l,--list     : List packages that match a pattern.
                    This is the same as `dpkg -l`.
    -v,--version  : Show apttool-show version and exit.
```

## AptTool-Installed

Another helper script included that lists all packages installed after the
base packages (after OS install). It may not be %100 accurate, but it is
useful for building a list of all user-installed packages.

This is much quicker than `apttool -I`, and won't show most system packages.

```
Usage:
    apttool-installed -h | -v
    apttool-installed [PATTERN...]

Options:
    PATTERN       : One or more text/regex patterns to filter patterns.
                    This is just a shorter way to build multiple grep
                    patterns.
    -h,--help     : Show this message.
    -v,--version  : Show apttool-installed version and exit.
```

## Completions

There are `bash` and `oh-my-zsh` completion files included for the `apttool`
command. To install them just copy them into `/etc/bash_completion.d/` or
`~/.oh-my-zsh/completions`. See [installation help](#installation) for
details.

## Installation

Clone the repo and symlink/copy the necessary files. `apttool.py` and
`apttool-show.sh` can be symlinked somewhere in `$PATH`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/welbornprod/apttool
cd apttool

# Symlink the executables, assuming ~/.local/bin is in $PATH.
ln -s "$PWD/apttool.py" ~/.local/bin/apttool
ln -s "$PWD/aptool-show.sh" ~/.local/bin/apttool-show
ln -s "$PWD/aptool-installed.sh" ~/.local/bin/apttool-installed

# Symlink the completion files.
# BASH
ln -s "$PWD/_apttool.bash" /etc/bash_completion.d/apttool
# Oh-my-zsh
ln -s "$PWD/_apttool.zsh" ~/.oh-my-zsh/completions/_apttool
```

After that, you can run apttool with `apttool` and enjoy the basic
completions.
